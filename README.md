- Day 5 part 2 is currently a brute-force using part 1 (takes ~8.5 minutes on Ryzen 5 5600H). Map in reverse; find locations that there is a seed for?
- Day 12 part 1 is a brute-force, more elegant solution (albeit it only takes ~6 seconds) from solving part 2 (if ever, see below)?
- Day 12 part 2 not solved. No clue how to do it, and reusing part 1 will never finish running
- Day 14 part 2: Got some help from Copilot (see [inline comments](src/solvers/Day14.ts#L43)), but would like to return and figure out how to properly find a repeating sequence and the result after a billion cycles
- Day 17 not done yet, but have an idea
- Day 21 part 2 seems reasonable, but didn't feel like trying after looking at the solutions lol
